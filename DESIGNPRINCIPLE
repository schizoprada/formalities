A well-designed system prioritizes verification over prescription, ensuring that any valid construct can be expressed and evaluated without enforcing a predefined method of implementation. Instead of attempting to account for every possible use case, it should establish clear validation criteria that maintain logical and structural integrity while allowing for extensibility. The role of a framework is not to dictate how solutions must be built, but to provide the necessary constraints that guarantee correctness, coherence, and adaptability.

The system should maintain contextual awareness throughout interactions, providing relevant feedback based on validation results rather than predetermined patterns. This feedback should inform without constraining, offering insights into available components and validation criteria without dictating specific implementations.

By focusing on enabling rather than restricting, such a system empowers users to explore, create, and refine solutions within a structured yet open-ended environment, ensuring both flexibility and rigor in execution. It should embrace runtime adaptability, allowing generated components to be validated against existing frameworks without requiring those components to be predefined within the system itself.
