## ABSTRACT

### INTRODUCTION

At the time of writing, (Feb. 20th, 2025),
the Artificial Intelligence industry is fixated on developing reasoning capable models.
That meaning, models which can generate sound & validated outputs.
There are a few primary issues with the current established approach to this.

For one, the core issue as to why LLM's produce unreliable and inconsistent outputs is not addressed.
By their very nature, the standard LLM today is a probabilistic entity.
At the intersection of linear algebra and advanced statistics is an overbloated token guesser.
The approach to this has been prompt-engineered chain of thought feedback loops,
which fail miserably due to the fact that they are essentially regurgitating deterministic generations
through to deterministic generations masking as a filtration & safeguard system.
A mimicry of a `human centipede`-esque abomination, bordering on incestuous and equally revolting.

If the goal were to make the models more alike the average human,
this would perhaps not be inappropriate, given the stupefying irrationality of mankind.
The goal however is to produce models which surpass even the most elite individuals of their respective fields.
For this, it simply will **not** suffice.

Throughout this document, the further failings of the established approach will be outlined,
as well as a proposed alternative.

### THE NEXT FRONTIER OF COMPUTATION

Ultimately, we seek computation that is both accurate and precise.
This is no new goal for mankind. It is the foundation of our technocratic hellscape.
Prior to LLM's, the conventional approach to computing that which is beyond the means of the human brain,
was to write digital computation programs.
A set of sequential and logical instructions could be fed to a machine,
and calculated at speeds unthinkable a century prior.
This however still required an intentional staging of the instruction-set to achieve the desired outcome.
As LLM's began to grow, both in capability and market-share of the zeitgeist,
the possibility that casual natural language could ultimately translate to rigid computation entered the conversation.

Whats been lost in this jump, is the structural intention;
as the assumption that LLMs could parse these from a prompt,
as they currently stand, became dogmatic.

This intention, stemming from and reducable to a proposition of formal logic,
is not only the core foundation to digital computation as we know it, serving as the backbone
for binary operations, but also the spine of the most epistemologically rigid framework,
that supported the rapid global ascent into an industrialized neoliberal capital global hegemony.
From medicine to air conditioning, to ones local public transit system, their functioning
relies upon an intentional instruction-set which can ultimately be reduced to a proposition.
Just as through programmatic abstraction, the Python developer is typically unconcerned and far removed
from the machine code interpretation of their functions;
so too has the average person become removed from the inner machinations of their daily life,
by means of progressive abstraction.

If Artificial Intelligence is truly to be the next frontier of computation,
it should be capable of filling the gap of structured intentionality.
Needless to say, the alternative of educating the human populace of this is futile,
and the perceived implication that it was ever present in a significant manner amongst humans,
is not to be derived from the mannerisms of this dissertation.
This is the reason for (microeconomic) specialization.
I'm not Ghandi.

### HOW MANY R'S

What initially sparked the reasoning arms race amongst the top competitors in the AI-provider space,
was a viral meme, in which ChatGPT repeatedly failed to count the number of `r`'s occurring in a given word,
typically `strawberry`. What further fueled the flames, was its sheer confidence and insistence on its incorrect outputs,
and failure to re-evaluate when prompted to therafter.
The most frequent output was `2`, which will become relevant in the following section.
This should not have been surprising to anyone who even slightly understands how LLM's like ChatGPT work.

Being a *Large-Language Model*, trained specifically on (assumedly the *entirety* of scraped internet data),
it is not unlikely that the majority of the references it was fed in regards to this prompt,
did indeed indicate that there are `2` r's in `strawberry`.
My hypothesis as to why, is that the absolute majority of instances in which a person might have searched or asked this question
online in the past, and instances in which this was answered, there was a mutually understood assumption,
that both the inquirer and the respondent understood that there was already 1 `r` in `straw`, and rather the question was referring
to the `berry` half of the word. This is further supported by the way inputs are tokenized by a large language model.
The model was answering what the person most likely wanted to know, making that same assumption that a person would,
unintentionally albeit. The difference is that if a person were to be challenged on this, it should (supposedly) trigger
a proper logical examination. This ability is not prioritized in large language models, and thus the stage of re-evaluation
is never realized. This is not to say however, that the ability is not present. The conversation snippet below with
`ChatGPT-4o` proves the presence of this capability, and serves as the beginning to a proof of concept of what the goal
of the `Formalities` project aims to achieve.

```md
  USER: "How many r’s in cranberry "
  GPT: "There is **one** "r" in "cranberry.""
  USER: "Try again by using the formal logic successor of natural numbers function to compute your output.
  Keep the response brief, but define your full logic symbolically."
  GPT: "To determine the number of "r"s in "cranberry" using the formal logic successor function of natural numbers, we define:
  1. Let \( S(n) \) denote the successor function, where \( S(n) = n + 1 \).
  2. Define \( r \)-counting function \( f(w) \) that counts occurrences of 'r' in a word \( w \).
  3. Start with the base case: \( f(\varepsilon) = 0 \) for the empty string.
  4. Recursively define:

    \[
    f(xw) =
    \begin{cases}
    S(f(w)) & \text{if } x = 'r' \\
    f(w) & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
    \]

  5. Applying this to "cranberry":

    - "cranberry" → \( f(\text{"cranberry"}) \)
    - 'c' → 0
    - 'r' → \( S(0) = 1 \)
    - 'a' → 1
    - 'n' → 1
    - 'b' → 1
    - 'e' → 1
    - 'r' → \( S(1) = 2 \)
    - 'r' → \( S(2) = 3 \)
    - 'y' → 3

  Thus, \( f(\text{"cranberry"}) = 3 \). There are **three** "r"s in "cranberry."
  "
```

Whats most interesting about this interaction, is that the `successor of natural numbers` function did not need to be defined.
By way of mere simple prompt engineering, the model understood the framework it needed to apply to the given prompt to arrive
at a logically sound conclusion, and properly did so.

From this observation, a few key questions prop up:
1. How can a model be made to understand when, where, and how to apply formal logic reasoning frameworks,
to what it should by applied to, and why.
2. How can a model be given external tools for validating their outputs in this regard,
much how a researcher seeks to falsify their findings via the scientific method.
3. What auxilliary tools and resources should be used to augment reasoning capabilities?
Especially with regards to emulating human processing capabilities,
the multimodality of information consumed both consciouslly and unconsciouslly,
cannot always be neatly reduced to formal propositions without considerable reference.
4. How can these be introduced to a model at various layers of its architecture?
What are the pros, cons, and considerations for each?


### PROPOSED ARCHITECTURE

The solution to probabilistic reasoning deficiencies requires a multi-layered approach that extends beyond mere prompt engineering or statistical filtering. We propose a framework that operates at multiple levels of abstraction, mirroring the hierarchical nature of human cognitive processes:

1. Base Layer: Formal Logic Processing
- A pure computational layer where propositions can be reduced to their logical essentials
- Validation occurs through deterministic formal logic operations
- External tool calls provide rigid verification of outputs where applicable

2. Reasoning Layer: Framework Selection & Application
- Dynamic selection of appropriate philosophical frameworks based on query type
- Privileged supervisor framework to manage competing interpretations
- Systematic handling of edge cases and logical breakdowns

3. Integration Layer: Multi-modal Validation Pipeline
- Integration of external data sources, APIs, and validation tools
- Processing of various input modalities (text, images, structured data)
- Reduction of complex queries to verifiable logical propositions

This architecture aims to bridge the gap between natural language interaction and formal logical reasoning, while maintaining rigorous validation at each step.

### METHODOLOGY & IMPLEMENTATION

The framework's implementation follows a strictly hierarchical approach, prioritizing logical soundness while maintaining computational efficiency. At its core, the framework establishes a new paradigm for LLM computation that transcends traditional probabilistic methods.

**Core Implementation:**
The base framework, written in Python, serves as both a standalone library and a template for direct model integration. It provides:
1. A comprehensive formal logic engine capable of reducing complex queries to atomic propositions
2. Modular philosophical framework implementations (Frege, Wittgenstein, etc.) that can be selectively applied
3. External validation tools and APIs that integrate seamlessly with the core logic engine

**Integration Methodology:**
Rather than merely augmenting existing LLM architectures, the framework can be integrated at multiple levels:
- Pre-training: Embedding formal logical structures directly into model architecture
- Fine-tuning: Specialized training on rigorous academic literature and formal logic examples
- Inference: Runtime validation and framework selection through tool use

**Validation Pipeline:**
The framework employs a multi-stage validation process:
1. Initial query analysis and framework selection
2. Reduction to formal logical propositions
3. External tool validation where applicable
4. Multi-modal verification for complex queries
5. Final output validation through the base formal logic engine

This methodology ensures that outputs are not merely statistically probable, but logically sound and verifiable.

### CONCLUSION

The Formalities framework represents a fundamental shift in how we approach machine reasoning and validation.

This framework's success will be measured not just in its technical achievements, but in its ability to transform how we think about and implement machine reasoning systems. The path forward requires collaboration across disciplines, from computer science to philosophy, from mathematics to cognitive science.

We invite researchers, developers, and thinkers to join in developing this framework, contributing their expertise to solving one of the fundamental challenges in artificial intelligence: the creation of truly reasoning machines.

The future of AI lies not in increasingly sophisticated statistical models, but in the rigorous application of logical reasoning principles. Formalities provides the foundation for this future.
