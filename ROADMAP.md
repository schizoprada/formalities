# ROADMAP

**INTRO**
The project can be conceptualized as existing in and progressing through 2 parts, each with their own number of phases.

Firstly, as a utility suite, this is where the portability comes into play.
A plug and play system that can be attached to any tool-use-capable LLM to instantly
provide a significant upgrade in reasoning capabilities.

Then, as an embedded framework within a proprietary flagship model.
This will take place at various injunctions of the models architecture,
including training, finetuning, and otherwise.
