To get started with FALL, I recommend a phased approach that builds the language from the ground up while ensuring each component is well-tested and integrates with the rest of the framework. Here's how I'd proceed:
Phase 1: Language Definition and Lexical Analysis

First, formalize the language specification in the grammar module:

keywords.py: Define all reserved words and tokens (DEFINE, RULE, AXIOM, WHERE, etc.)
rules.py: Specify syntax rules for each language construct
semantics.py: Define semantic meanings and validations


Implement the lexer in parser/lexing.py:

Create a token system with types, values, positions
Implement a scanner that converts text to token streams
Handle whitespace, comments, and basic symbols



Phase 2: Parser Implementation

Build the abstract syntax tree (AST) representation in parser/abstract.py:

Define node classes for each language construct
Create a visitor pattern for traversing the AST
Implement pretty-printing for debugging


Develop the parser in parser/parsing.py:

Implement recursive descent parsing
Build grammar rules for each language construct
Generate AST from token stream


Create simple unit tests with basic FALL programs to test the parser

Phase 3: Basic Execution

Implement the interpreter in runtime/interpreter.py:

Create an execution context for tracking state
Implement visitors for evaluating AST nodes
Support basic operations (variable definition, assertions)


Add validation in runtime/validator.py:

Implement basic type checking
Validate rule applications
Check for logical consistency



Phase 4: Integration

Develop bridge components:

bridges/logic.py: Convert FALL constructs to core Formalities types
bridges/nlp.py: Extract linguistic patterns for FALL constructs
bridges/llm.py: Interface with LLM tool calls


Create a tool interface in utils/toolcalls.py:

Implement the fall_executor tool
Handle parsing, execution, and result formatting



Phase 5: Proof System

Enhance the proof capabilities in runtime/executor.py:

Implement the proof engine
Support step-by-step application of axioms
Add inference tracking


Add more sophisticated validation:

Framework-specific validation
Cross-framework compatibility checking
Semantic verification
