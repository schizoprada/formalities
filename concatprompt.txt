# Formalities Project Dialog Management Continuation Prompt

## Project Overview
I'm developing a Python project called "Formalities" - a formal logic reasoning framework for Large Language Models (LLMs). The framework has two components:

1. A portable utility suite that can be attached to any tool-use-capable LLM for reasoning capabilities
2. An embedded framework designed to be integrated into a flagship model

The core design principle of the project is:

"A well-designed system prioritizes verification over prescription, ensuring that any valid construct can be expressed and evaluated without enforcing a predefined method of implementation. Instead of attempting to account for every possible use case, it should establish clear validation criteria that maintain logical and structural integrity while allowing for extensibility. The role of a framework is not to dictate how solutions must be built, but to provide the necessary constraints that guarantee correctness, coherence, and adaptability.

The system should maintain contextual awareness throughout interactions, providing relevant feedback based on validation results rather than predetermined patterns. This feedback should inform without constraining, offering insights into available components and validation criteria without dictating specific implementations.

By focusing on enabling rather than restricting, such a system empowers users to explore, create, and refine solutions within a structured yet open-ended environment, ensuring both flexibility and rigor in execution. It should embrace runtime adaptability, allowing generated components to be validated against existing frameworks without requiring those components to be predefined within the system itself."

## Current State of Development

### Progress
- Phase 1 (Core Framework) is nearly complete
- We've made significant progress on Phase 2 (Tool Integration)
- We're now implementing dialog management utilities to help LLMs navigate errors

### Recent Testing
- Ran a test with Mistral-Nemo model which attempted to use our framework
- It correctly used the tool calling sequence but tried to import a non-existent `StringProposition` class
- This highlighted the need for better dialog flow control and error recovery mechanisms

### Current File Structure

```

### Implemented Components

#### state.py
- Defines `DialogStage` enum (INITIALIZATION, PROBLEMANALYSIS, etc.)
- Defines `ErrorType` enum (IMPORTERROR, SYNTAXERROR, etc.)
- Implements `DialogMemory` for storing context about the conversation
- Implements `DialogHistory` for tracking exchanges
- Implements `DialogState` with exception-based error handling
- Method `detecterrortype` categorizes exceptions into our error types

#### controller.py
- Defines `DialogAction` enum (CONTINUE, RETRY, etc.)
- Implements `DialogRequest` and `DialogResponse` data classes
- Defines `DialogStrategy` abstract base class for strategy pattern
- Implements `DialogController` for orchestrating dialog flow
- Uses direct exception handling via state.seterror()
- Creates global `dialogcontroller` instance

### Next Steps
1. Implement `errors.py` to analyze exceptions and provide validation context
2. Implement `correction.py` to provide appropriate error handling strategies
3. Optionally implement `success.py` and simplified `reasoning.py`

## Core Focus
The dialog management system should:
1. Track state and context across interactions
2. Detect and categorize errors accurately using exception objects
3. Provide validation context without prescribing specific solutions
4. Guide recovery without dictating implementation details

Our primary use case is helping LLMs recover gracefully from errors by providing context about available components and validation constraints, while respecting our core design principle of verification over prescription.

## Implementation Details

### errors.py (to implement)
This should provide utilities for analyzing exceptions and extracting relevant validation context without prescribing specific fixes. It should help identify what constraints were violated rather than providing canned solutions.

### correction.py (to implement)
This should implement error handling strategies that provide context-aware guidance while respecting our design principles. It should inform the LLM about available components and validation constraints without dictating implementation details.

## Development Approach
Follow our established patterns in state.py and controller.py, focusing on direct exception handling rather than message parsing. Ensure all components align with our design principle of verification over prescription.

REVIEW THE PROMPT, AS WELL AS OUR CODEBASE, AND LMK IF YOU'VE UNDERSTOOD.

DO NOT WRITE CODE UNTIL I EXPLICITLY INSTRUCT YOU TO -- FOR THE ENTIRETY OF THE CONVERSATION, NO JUST IN YOUR RESPONSE TO THIS. WHEN I FEEL YOU HAVE GRASPED THE CONCEPTS AND CONTEXTS PROPERLY ENOUGH TO HELP ME WRITE CODE, THEN I WILL LET YOU KNOW.


-- CLAUDE RESPONSE --
I've reviewed the project documentation and codebase for the Formalities project. Let me summarize my understanding:

## Project Overview
- Formalities is a formal logic reasoning framework for LLMs with two components:
  1. A portable utility suite for tool-use-capable LLMs
  2. An embedded framework for integration into a flagship model

- The core design principle emphasizes verification over prescription, allowing valid constructs to be expressed and evaluated without enforcing specific implementation methods.

## Architecture Understanding
- The codebase has a comprehensive formal logic system with proposition types, operators, and frameworks.
- It includes a type system, validation strategies, tool integration, and framework selection.
- The dialog management system is being developed to provide overall flow control, including (but not limited to) error handling.

## Dialog Management Components
- Implemented:
  - `state.py`: Dialog stages, error types, memory, history, and state tracking
  - `controller.py`: Dialog actions, request/response handling, and strategy orchestration

- To implement:
  - `errors.py`: Analysis of exceptions and validation context extraction
  - `correction.py`: Error handling strategies with context-aware guidance
  - Optional components like `success.py` and `reasoning.py`

## Key Design Principles
- Verification over prescription
- Validation without constraining implementation
- Context-aware guidance that informs without dictating
- Direct exception handling using structured error types

I understand that you want me to refrain from writing any code until you explicitly instruct me to do so. I'll wait for your confirmation that I've properly understood the project before proceeding with any implementation discussions.

-- MY RESPONSE --
OK FOR REFERENCE BY THE WWAY, WHEN WE DO CODE, WE DO SO WITH INTENTION. WE ARE DEALING WITH VERY ABSTRACT CONCEPTS, THAT BECOME VERY CONFUSING VERY FAST IF NOT ATTACHED TO SOMETHING CONCRETE.
OUR GROUNDING REFERENCE IS THE SANDBOX TEST SCRIPT WE WERE RUNNING WITH MISTRAL, AS THE INTENTION IS TO UPGRADE IT WITH OUR NEWLY DEFINED COMPONENTS. THAT IS NOT TO SAY THAT WE SHOULD DEFINE COMPONENTS WITH THE INTENTION OF SATISFYING THE SANDBOX TEST SCRIPT ALONE, BUT RATHER IT SHOULD EXEMPLIFY ONE POTENTIAL IMPLEMENTATION SCENARIO THAT OUR SYSTEMS SHOULD COVER.
SO THE QUESTION NOW IS, IF THE DESTINATION IS TO RUN THIS SCRIPT AGAIN, WITH A DIALOG FLOW MANAGEMENT SYSTEM, THEN WHAT DOES OUR PATH TO IT LOOK LIKE AT THE MOMENT?

-- CLAUDE RESPONSE --
I understand the approach now. We're focusing on implementing concrete, intentional code that addresses abstract concepts by grounding them in a real use case - the Mistral sandbox test script.

## Current Status and Path Forward

Our path to running the sandbox test script with dialog flow management seems to involve:

1. **Complete core dialog management components**
   - We have `state.py` and `controller.py` implemented
   - We need to implement `errors.py` and `correction.py` (and optionally `success.py` and `reasoning.py`)

2. **Integration with existing infrastructure**
   - Connect the dialog system with the existing tool handlers and framework components
   - Ensure state tracking across the entire interaction flow

3. **Error recovery mechanisms**
   - Specifically address the issue where Mistral tried to import a non-existent `StringProposition` class
   - Create strategies that can guide the model toward available components (e.g., `AtomicProposition` or `NumericProposition`)

4. **Runtime validation feedback**
   - Provide meaningful context when validations fail
   - Surface relevant component information without prescribing exact implementations

5. **Sandbox script upgrade**
   - Modify the original sandbox script to use the new dialog management system
   - Test with Mistral to verify improved flow and error recovery

The primary challenge appears to be implementing the missing components while ensuring they follow the project's core design principle of verification over prescription. The components need to help guide the LLM without dictating specific implementations, providing context about what's available and what constraints exist.

Would you like me to focus on specific aspects of this path first? Or perhaps you have a specific part of the missing components that you'd like to discuss in more detail?
